#   Snippets I include in my .bashrc file.  After adding items, remember to
#   refresh it again by adding it to the source.

source .bashrc

#   Basic aliases that are common:

alias la='ls -a'
alias ll='ls -l'

#   I always prefer to always have the long view

alias ls='ls -l'

#   I like to keep an eye on my storage.  Adjust to your storage assignment

alias storage='echo "df -h"
	df -h /dev/sda{2,4}'

#   When adding snippets, I add them to a menu of items.  I use them frequently,
#   but I like to keep a reference of them in case I move between systems and
#   want to document what I have added.  I create a "snippets" menu.
